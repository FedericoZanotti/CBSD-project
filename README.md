# Classification and Reconstruction of dishonest of the IADQ questionnaire

This was a very difficult project for the course Cognitive Behavioral and Social Data. The professors had just given some datasets and he didn't give to the student more information. In my opinion the work my colleagues and me made was over too much, in the sense that we tried every thing and in particular we implemented a different apporach w.r.t the other students. 

The project has two purposes: the first one was to recognize if a subject had lied answering a psycological questionnaire. This is very interesting, because there are no way to identify a lier, except for some control questions that psycologhist insert in the questionnaires. The second purpose was to reconstruct the honest answers for a dishonest subject. This was really challenging and to be honest our work did not resolve this problem, but I think we faced in an original way. 
Although the project was really interesting the dataset is too little to create an algorithm that generalizes well. Infact how can we state if a subject lies in a dataset of 225 questionnaire answers? In my opinion, this was also a little bit unethical but the aims are good.
